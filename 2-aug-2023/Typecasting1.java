//================== TYPECASTING ==========================
//Type casting is a way of converting data from one data type to another data type.

// Type casting in Java refers to the process of converting a value of one data type to another.
//  This can be particularly useful when you want to perform operations or assignments involving different data types. 
//  There are two main types of type casting in Java: 
//  implicit (automatic) casting and also knows as Widening casting 
//  explicit (manual) casting also known as Narrowing casting or type conversion -----
